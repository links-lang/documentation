# Documentation

This repository contains the [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org) sources for an initial attempt at proper Links documentation. It is nowhere near complete, so please bear with us, but we're actively making an effort now.

To build the documentation, run `make html`. The HTML sources will be output into `_build/html`. A quick way to view the docs would be
```
  make html
  cd _build/html
  python3 -m http.server
```

(assuming a Python 3 executable of `python3`).

The docs will be hosted once they are deemed stable enough.
